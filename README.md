# Rock_and_Mine_Prediction
The Rock_and_Mine_Prediction project is a machine-learning project that uses sonar data to predict whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine. The project uses a dataset of 208 sonar signals, each labelled as a rock or a mine. The project aims to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the label of a sonar signal, given its features.
